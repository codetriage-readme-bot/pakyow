module Pakyow
  module Support
    # Makes it possible to define and call hooks on an object.
    #
    # Hooks can be defined at the class or instance level. When calling hooks
    # on an instance, hooks defined on the class will be called first.
    #
    # By default, hooks are called in the order they are defined. Each hook
    # can be assigned a relative priority to influence when it is to be called
    # (relative to other hooks of the same type). Default hook priority is `0`,
    # and can instead be set to `1` (high) or `-1` (low).
    #
    # @example
    #   class Fish
    #     include Pakyow::Support::Hookable
    #     events :swim
    #
    #     def swim
    #       performing :swim do
    #         puts "swimming"
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   Fish.before :swim do
    #     puts "prepping"
    #   end
    #
    #   fish = Fish.new
    #
    #   fish.after :swim do
    #     puts "resting"
    #   end
    #
    #   fish.swim
    #   => prepping
    #      swimming
    #      resting
